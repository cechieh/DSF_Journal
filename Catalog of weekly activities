# Welcome to the my_weekly_progress_as_DSF wiki!

# Week 1 
## What did you learn this week?
### Maliaca's welcome lecture introduced me to open science.
### for the first time I used the self assessment tool on open science.

##How did you apply/try to apply what you learned?
### I researched on other self assessment tools besides the one used in the class.
### I administered this tool on my friends and peers and they were as surprised as me that such exists

## What will you do next?
### I hope document the poor adoption of open science by researchers in my home country. This may be the beginning open science advocacy in the tropics.

# Week 2
## What did you learn this week?
### Greg's lecture on introduction to github made me dust my github account.
## How did you apply/try to apply what you learned?
### for the first time I prepared a presentation using github. This presentation was my [DSF Introduction](https://github.com/cechieh/DSF/wiki/My-DSF-Introduction)

## What will you do next?
### I hope to routinely use github for my manuscript preparation.

# Week 3 
## What did you learn this week?
### This week I learnt the ethics of data from Lydia's presentation on moving from data "wardship" to data sovereignty. The concepts of Helicopter science was entirely new to me.

## What will you do next?
### I hope to include more community paticipation in my community based research. I once worked my boss to obtain data on wound practices in the community, if I were do that work all over, I will do it differently.

# Week 4
## This week we had conversations on github licenses and posting data as public versus private on github.
While many peers are comfortable with public sharing of data and use of MIT github license, I am constrained by the fact that most of my work currently involving secondary data analyses and I am made to agree to data use agreement which limits me from sharing data or permitting others to share data obtained from databases. From this background, I decided to keep my github data private for now. Thisdoes not go against the FAIR principles since the dataset is already available in repositories that are accessible on request.

# Week 5
## What did you learn this week?
###We discussed Cyverse in our group challenge.
### I learned a lot about project management and documentation. 
### I worked with Carlos to debug a challenge I have converting a dataset from STATA to SPSS. This took 2whole hours of Carlos's time and I am so grateful to him for dedicating so much time to me.


##How did you apply/try to apply what you learned?
### I was able to try out google colab for the first time.

## What will you do next?
### Improve my coding skills and find more applicable skill to my clinical practice.
### with my data now in SPSS, I will be able to collaborate with my clinician colleage to prepare an abstract for presentation at the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Meeting scheduled for next year.


# Week 6

##
### Attended Carlos"s Python class where we talked about Panda.
### while a lot of the demonstrations by Carlos were new to me, I am grateful for the exposure.

## What will you do next?
### Improve my coding skills and find more applicable skill to my clinical practice.
### I worked on my manuscript for the conference hence my attention to details and recall of DSF activities were reduced.


# Week 7
## I submitted my abstract for the conference.
## I attended Greg's session on R.
## I had a challenge with pushing from R to github because of git cofig --global.user "username" code was not running.
## I will find a way to trouble shoot on this

# Week 8
## This week was challenging because we talked about automation in Cyverse. 
## FOllowing this conversation I am consideration how to automate a medical record platform to allow for extraction of personal heart information in a way that is adaptable to open science.
The taughts are still fluid but I reason that if the EMR platform is such that it can de-identify subjects and instead attach an unintelligible identification codes at time of extraction, it can allow for a more open data extraction.

## This week, I had a challenge with my Cyverse account as I hit a glitch and was notified that I had exceeded my compute limit on Cyverse.
## I had to contact cyverse to give me some allowance following which it seems I lost some data. 
## The lessons I learned from this experience is not to have a single copy of my data. This will allow replacement when the need arises.

## On our group challenge, I also had difficulty with the code hit config --global.user "esername"
## I am still working on this as at the time of this entry.
# Here is my introduction to DSF

# Week 9
##In our journal club this week, we talked about writting skills.
I learned the writting skill of sentence position and emphasis postion when formulating sententences.
I hope to discuss this concept with my peers in the lab.
The concept of reverse editing was also very interesting to apply to scientific writting.
## In this weeks DSF lecture, we had an overview of statistics. I learned that for correlation the coefficient depicts the number of multiples the dependable variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable 
## THis week in our challenge, Greg and I troubleshooted a difference we say between the desktop and the Cyverse versions of R. The challenge was in pushing from R to Git in the cyverse version. 
## This restriction mut be a security to to protect multiple users of the cyverse version of R.

# Week 10
In our DSF Lesson this week, Carlos took us through Data Visualization.
The difficulties were in getting the softwares ready. We installed VS Code and Docker container but I ran on Anaconda Jupyter notebook
Here is a html file of my activity out put http://localhost:8888/notebooks/ExploratoryDataAnalysis-Seaborn_Carlos.ipynb

# Week 11 07_11_2022 
## THis week, we had a lecture on data visualization.
## The group challenge was to critically review a data visualization
## The github document to github document on my group challenge task can be found here https://github.com/cechieh1/DSI/commit/18c48dcdb6fc30bc3223712d455b3d545b513408
# Here is the project I am currently working on

# Week 12
This week we had a lesson on Machine learning.
The challenge gave me an opportunity to try my hands on machine learning.
Here are links to my efforts
https://github.com/cechieh/DSF/blob/main/challenge_machine_learning.ipynb
https://github.com/cechieh/DSF/blob/main/OverviewMLAlgorithms2.ipynb

I will go ahead to prepare for FOSS presenstations.
